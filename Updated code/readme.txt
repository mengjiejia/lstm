Hey Ashok, finally I upload the code :) Here are some notes:

1. Please find the training and test dataset in 'turn dataset' folder.

2. The abnormaly detection only works in the stable stage, so you can start design the attack pattern for stable stage first. As to turning stage, there are still some issues I need to deal with and I am working on it. 

3. I also upload the best trained model I got so far included in the 'turn3_roll_newtset' folder. You can use this model directly or train some new models for your work.

4. Feel free to ask me any questions cuz I know the code is still a little bit messy and reading the code written by others sometimes can drive us crazy ^_^
